# Neural Network from Scratch â€“ MNIST Classification with PyTorch

This is my first neural network project, built from scratch using **PyTorch** to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**.

The project aims to provide a hands-on understanding of how a simple feedforward neural network works â€” from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## ðŸ“š Project Structure

- **Data loading:** Uses `torchvision.datasets.MNIST` to download and load training images.
- **Data transformation:** Images are transformed into tensors using `ToTensor()`.
- **Data visualization:** Displays sample images from the dataset with `matplotlib`.
- **Model definition:** A basic fully-connected neural network built with `torch.nn.Module`.
- **Training loop:** Custom training function using `SGD` optimizer with momentum.
- **Evaluation:** Measures accuracy of the model on training data (can be extended to include validation).
